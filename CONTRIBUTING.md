## Contributing

When adding new datasets, follow these guidelines:

1. Place the dataset in a subdirectory under `src`.
2. Data should be in an easy machine-readable format, such as simple plain text, CSV, JSON, etc.
3. **Ensure the data is open.**
4. Provide the full name, and a link to the source URL, in [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md).
